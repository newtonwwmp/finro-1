                <p>We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you,
                    providing information to our clients and marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for
                    secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would
                    reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists at
                    any time by contacting us in writing.</p>

                    why we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.</p>

                <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
                <p>Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act to include information or opinion about such

                <p>Sensitive information will be used by us only:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose</li>
                    <li>With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Third Parties</h3>
                <p>Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you.
                    However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case
                    we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by
                    the third party.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>

                <p>When your Personal Information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was obtained, we will
                    take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information. However, most
                    of the Personal Information is or will be stored in client files which will be kept by us for a
